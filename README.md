# The simITS Package

This package is for analyzing ITS designs with parametric simulation and extrapolation

Active code is on github, with clean releases posted to CRAN.

## How to learn how to use this package

I would recommend starting by reading the methods overview paper, "Using Simulation to Analyze Interrupted Time Series Designs", on ArXiV <https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05746>.

There is also a vignettes in the package that walks through almost everything.


## Disclaimer

The post-stratified ITS code is both messier and less developed.  There are multiple ways one might adjust for time-varying covariates, and this is an active area of ongoing research.  Buyer beware!


## Making contributions

You are most welcome to check out a copy from github <https://github.com/lmiratrix/simITS> and play with the code. All suggestions and improvements most welcome!
