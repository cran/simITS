#' \code{simITS} package overview
#'
#' Analysis via Simulation of Interrupted Time Series
#'
#' This package is based on the backbone analytic code for the analyses in,
#' e.g., Redcross et al. (2019) or Golub et al. (2019).  See companion paper
#' Miratrix (2020) for technical discussion of the overall approach.
#'
#' Broadly, this package provides methods for fitting Interrupted Time Series
#' models with lagged outcomes and variables to account for temporal
#' dependencies.  It then conducts inference via simulation, simulating a set of
#' plausible counterfactual post-policy series to compare to the observed
#' post-policy series. This package provides methods to visualize such data, and
#' also to incorporate seasonality models and smoothing and
#' aggregation/summarization. See the vignette for a guide of how to conduct
#' such analyses.
